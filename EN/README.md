# Operation Digital Ant
Potential insiders are individuals with privileged access to IT components, IT services, installations, documents or other critical information and devices. Because of their access and knowledge, they are particularly dangerous and at the same time difficult to defend against.


With the tabletop game __Operation Digital Ant__, possible attacks by insiders in food production and logistics as well as possible countermeasures can be identified. Several teams play the role of malicious insiders and compete against each other.


The game is part of the [NutriSafe Toolkits](https://nutrisafe.de/toolkit) and is developed by [Manfred Hofmeier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ma-hofmeier/) at the Institute for Protection and Dependability of the Universit채t der Bundeswehr M체nchen.

## Use
The serious game __Operation Digital Ant__ is a tabletop game, which can be played both in a face-to-face event and virtually. For a virtual event a video conferencing tool with breakout function is required. Use the digital card deck in such events.
